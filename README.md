# Batch-classifier

Code implementation of the methods in our paper. The paper is available at.Wu H, Chen X, Cheng G, et al.

What the project does? This project consists of two parts: "bcac_project" and "back-end traffic classification code". the former implements the replay, capture and feature extraction of network traffic packets. The latter completes the clustering and classification of the back-end traffic. Detailed descriptions of these two functional modules can be found in the readme files of each module.
